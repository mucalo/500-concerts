# Can I see 500 more concerts in my lifetime?

My friend **Kre≈°o**, for my 41st birthday (21st May 2025), said _"Happy birthday, all the luck, love, hapiness bla bla and may we go to 500 more concerts together..."_. Chances of us going to 500 concerts together is zero. But, will I get to see 500 more concerts?

Well, here is the list:

1. **Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band**, Prague, 15th June 2025
2. **InMusic day 1 (Fontaines DC, Streets, Air)**, Zagreb, 23rd June 2025
