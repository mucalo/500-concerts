# (22/500) Can I see 500 more concerts in my lifetime?

My friend **Krešo**, for my 41st birthday (May 2025), said _"Happy birthday, all the luck, love, hapiness bla bla and may we go to 500 more concerts together..."_. Chances of us going to 500 concerts together is zero. But, will I get to see 500 more concerts?
